### Decision Making:

#### 1. **Biome**

**Why Biome Instead of ESLint and Prettier?**
- Combines linting, formatting, and organization into a single tool.
- Simplifies the configuration process, reducing cognitive overhead for developers.
- Faster performance compared to the combination of ESLint and Prettier.
- Automatically enforces consistent coding standards without additional plugins.

**Addressing Challenges**:
- Eliminates the need for managing multiple configurations for linting and formatting.
- Improves team-wide code consistency without the friction of integrating multiple tools.

#### 2. **Storybook**

**Why Storybook?**
- Provides an isolated environment to develop and test components visually.
- Acts as living documentation, enabling new team members to quickly understand how to use components.
- Enhances collaboration between developers and designers._(It helps that Amex uses it for their design system.)_
- Supports accessibility and responsive design testing.

**Key Benefits**:
- Encourages atomic design principles by showcasing components individually.
- Reduces integration errors by verifying component behavior in isolation.

#### 3. Styled Components
**Why CSS Styled Components?**
- Styled-components allow for CSS-in-JS, keeping styles scoped to specific components.

Benefits:
- Prevents global namespace pollution.
- Dynamically applies styles based on props (e.g., variant, size).
- Removes the need for class name conventions like BEM.

#### 4. **Time-Constrained Development**

When deadlines are tight, consider the following:
- **Prebuilt Libraries**: Tools like TailwindCSS or ShadCDN can provide a quick way to create consistent UIs.
- **Transition Plan**: Begin with prebuilt libraries and replace them incrementally with custom-built components once requirements stabilize.
- The plan initially was to use a prebuilt library, but I read, Build a repository that we could use as a foundation for a component library., so I went with the latter.

#### 5. **Rollup JS-- Setup and build component libary**

**Why Rollup?** Its optimized for building libraries, offering a smaller and more efficient bundle compared to Webpack.
- **The JavaScript module bundler**: Compile small pieces of code into something larger and more complex
- **Tree-shaking**: Removes unused code, reducing bundle size.
- **Code-splitting w/o overhead**: Rollup splits code into chunks automatically, like dynamic loading or multiple entry points, and there is a way to explicitly tell Rollup which modules to split into separate chunk
- **Handles special needs**: With many configuration options and a rich interface to make the ideal bundler for your project.
- Unopionated, flexible, and extensible.
- Much like a ðŸŒ­, it's easily configurable for modern library needs.
