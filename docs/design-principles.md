## üèóÔ∏è Design Principles

Building a reusable component library requires following principles that ensure scalability, maintainability, and accessibility:

### **1. Scalability**
- **Modular Design:** Each component resides in its own directory with logic, styles, types, and tests.
- **CStyled Components:** Use scoped styles to prevent namespace conflicts.

### **2. Flexibility**
- Design components to be customizable and reusable:
  - Props allow dynamic behavior (e.g., `size`, `variant`).
  - Use `React.ComponentProps` to inherit native HTML attributes like `id` and `aria-*`.

### **3. Accessibility (a11y)**
- Prioritize inclusivity:
  - Include ARIA roles and attributes for interactive components.
  - Implement focus management and keyboard navigation for modals and forms.
  - Test using accessibility tools and checklists (e.g., W3C guidelines).

### **4. Single Responsibility Principle**
- Keep each component focused on one task:
  - E.g., a `Modal` handles rendering, close actions, and animations but doesn‚Äôt manage global state.

### **5. Composition Over Inheritance**
- Combine smaller components to create more complex ones:
  - E.g., a `Card` component can be composed of `CardHeader`, `CardBody`, and `CardFooter`.
